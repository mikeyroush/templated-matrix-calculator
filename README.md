# templated-matrix-calculator

This project implements a templated matrix class with overloaded operators to support addition and multiplication.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

A working command line

### Installing and Running

Download the zip then link the files in the command line via the makefile and run the executable

Navigate to the correct directory and utilize the makefile

```console
foo@bar:~$ cd /path/to/directory/here
foo@bar:~$ make all
```

This will have created a few .o files and an executable. To run it, do as follows...

```console
foo@bar:~$ ./main
```

Demo

```console
initialize matrix m1 with integers
1 3
1 2

initialize matrix m2 with integers from input file
1 2
2 1

add/multiply m1 and m2 and store in m3
adding
2 5
3 3

multiplying
7 5
5 4

initialize m4 with doubles
1.1 3.1
1.1 2.1

initialize m5 with longs
11111111111111 11111111111111
11111111111111 11111111111111
